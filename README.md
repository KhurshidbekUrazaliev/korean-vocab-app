# Korean Vocabulary Practice App

A fun and interactive web app I built to help me (and anyone else!) practice Korean vocabulary. Features flashcards and quizzes with 10 essential Korean words from Day 05 of my learning journey.

## What It Does

This app has two modes:
- **Flashcard Mode** - Click cards to flip them and see the English translations. Great for casual learning.
- **Quiz Mode** - Multiple choice questions to test yourself. Shows your score at the end.

## Why I Built This

I'm learning Korean and wanted a more engaging way to practice vocabulary instead of just staring at my notebook. Plus, I wanted to learn React, so this was a perfect starter project!

## Tech Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Lucide React (for icons)

## Running It Locally

If you want to run this on your own computer:

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/korean-vocab-app.git
cd korean-vocab-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app should open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## Live Demo

## What I Learned

- Building interactive React components with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Managing state across different app modes
- Creating responsive layouts with Tailwind
- Deploying a React app to GitHub Pages

## Future Ideas

Some things I might add:
- More vocabulary sets (Days 01-04, 06-10, etc.)
- Audio pronunciation
- Progress tracking
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Dark mode

## The Vocabulary

Here are the 10 words included:
- 결정하다 (gyeoljeong-hada) - to decide
- 의견 (uigyeon) - opinion
- 차이 (chai) - difference
- 모이다 (moida) - to gather
- 찬성하다 (chanseong-hada) - to agree
- 반대하다 (bandae-hada) - to oppose
- 충분히 (chungbun-hi) - sufficiently
- 만족하다 (manjok-hada) - to be satisfied
- 방향 (banghyang) - direction
- 선택하다 (seontaek-hada) - to choose
